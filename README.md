# 🧠 Oral Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on the early detection of **oral cancer** using **machine learning and deep learning models**.
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing oral cancer at an early stage, improving patient outcomes, and reducing the time required for manual analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a deep learning model to classify oral cancer vs. healthy tissue images.
* Improve accuracy using **CNN-based architectures**.
* Provide an easy-to-use interface for prediction.
* Contribute to healthcare AI by creating an open-source framework for oral cancer detection.

## 🗂️ Dataset

* The dataset consists of **oral cancer and non-cancer images**.
* Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation (rotation, flipping, contrast enhancement).
* (Add your dataset source link here if public, or mention it’s private.)

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

   * Image cleaning, resizing, and augmentation.
2. **Model Development**

   * CNN / Transfer Learning (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet).
3. **Training & Evaluation**

   * Training with different hyperparameters.
   * Evaluation using metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**.
4. **Deployment**

   * Model saved in `.h5` / `.pt` format.
   * Simple web-app / notebook-based interface for prediction.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * TensorFlow / PyTorch
  * OpenCV
  * NumPy, Pandas
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
* **Deployment Options:** Streamlit / Flask (optional)

## 📊 Results

* Achieved **XX% accuracy** on validation set.
* Model shows promising results in distinguishing oral cancer from healthy images.
* Confusion matrix and ROC curve included in results.
